# Snake Game Project Rules

## Theme
- Dark cyberpunk aesthetic with neon accents
- Primary color: Neon green (#00ff88) for snake and interactive elements
- Accent color: Orange (#ff6b35) for food/eggs
- Background: Deep dark (#0a0a0f) with subtle grid (#1a1a2e)
- Use glow/shadow effects for depth and visual appeal
- Animations should be smooth and subtle (pulse effects, transitions)

## Architecture
- Keep game logic in GameScreen.tsx with React state and setInterval
- Renderer components (Snake, Food) are pure presentational
- Constants centralized in src/constants.ts
- Storage utilities in src/utils/storage.ts
- Use TypeScript strict typing for Position, Direction types

## Code Style
- Functional components with hooks only
- Use useCallback for event handlers and memoized functions
- Use useRef for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders (direction refs)
- Keep files under 300 lines; split if larger
- No classes; prefer simple functions

## Game Mechanics
- Grid dynamically sized based on screen dimensions
- Cell size: 12px for dense grid
- Snake grows by 1 cell per egg consumed
- Score: +10 points per egg
- Game over on wall collision or self-collision
- High scores persisted via AsyncStorage

## Dependencies
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for persistence
- react-native-sound for game audio effects
- No game engine library needed; plain React state works

## Navigation
- HomeScreen: Main menu with play button and instructions
- GameScreen: Active gameplay with exit button to return home
- Navigation managed via simple state in App.tsx
